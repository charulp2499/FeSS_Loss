# FESS Loss: Feature-Enhanced Spatial Segmentation Loss
<div style="text-align: justify">

## Introduction
This repository contains the implementation of the Feature-Enhanced Spatial Segmentation Loss (FESS Loss) proposed in the research paper titled "FESS Loss: Feature-Enhanced Spatial Segmentation Loss for Optimizing Medical Image Analysis." FESS Loss is designed to improve the accuracy and precision of medical image segmentation by combining contrastive learning with the spatial accuracy provided by the Dice loss.

## Abstract
Medical image segmentation is a critical process in the field of medical imaging, playing a pivotal role in diagnosis, treatment, and research. Conventional methods often struggle with balancing spatial precision and comprehensive feature representation. FESS Loss addresses this challenge by integrating the benefits of contrastive learning with the spatial accuracy inherent in the Dice loss. This README provides an overview of the implementation and usage of FESS Loss.

## Features
- Integration of contrastive learning for improved feature representation
- Enhanced spatial accuracy through Dice loss
