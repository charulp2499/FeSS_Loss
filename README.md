# FESS Loss: Feature-Enhanced Spatial Segmentation Loss

## Introduction
This repository contains the implementation of the Feature-Enhanced Spatial Segmentation Loss (FESS Loss) proposed in the research paper titled "FESS Loss: Feature-Enhanced Spatial Segmentation Loss for Optimizing Medical Image Analysis." FESS Loss is designed to improve the accuracy and precision of medical image segmentation by combining contrastive learning with the spatial accuracy provided by the Dice loss.

## Abstract
Medical image segmentation is a critical process in the field of medical imaging, playing a pivotal role in diagnosis, treatment, and research. Conventional methods often struggle with balancing spatial precision and comprehensive feature representation. FESS Loss addresses this challenge by integrating the benefits of contrastive learning with the spatial accuracy inherent in the Dice loss. This README provides an overview of the implementation and usage of FESS Loss.

## Features
- Integration of contrastive learning for improved feature representation
- Enhanced spatial accuracy through Dice loss
- Superior performance in limited annotated data scenarios

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Required dependencies (list them if any)

### Installation
Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/charulp2499/FeSS_Loss.git
cd FeSS_Loss
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage
To use FESS Loss in your project, follow these steps:

1. Import the FESS Loss module:

```python
from fess_loss import FESSLoss
```

2. Initialize FESS Loss:

```python
fess_loss = FESSLoss()
```

3. Use it in your training loop:

```python
# Example code to use FESS Loss
loss = fess_loss.calculate_loss(predictions, ground_truth)
# Your backpropagation and optimization steps here
```

Make sure to replace `predictions` and `ground_truth` with your actual model predictions and ground truth labels.
